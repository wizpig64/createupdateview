CreateUpdateView
================

CreateUpdateView combines Django's Create and Update generic views.

Built for Django 1.5, but it could work with any other version of django
that uses class based views, assuming library locations haven't moved.

It's very simple code, probably best to just paste it into your project
rather than anybody spending time creating a plugin.
